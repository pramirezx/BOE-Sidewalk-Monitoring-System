## Web UI Team ##

UI Team's main task is to be able to develop an interactive user-friendly UI that is able to display specific or individual sidewalk segment images and its slope data. 

To run the React App:

4. Then run the command: **npm start**

To extract data from GoPro images: 
1. Use the exifDataExtract.py file
